03.  Add a pair of radio buttons

Add a pair of radio buttons to your form, each nested in its own label element.
One should have the option of indoor and the other should have the option of outdoor.
Both should share the name attribute of indoor-outdoor to create a radio group.

<input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">
<label for="indoor">Indoor</label>
